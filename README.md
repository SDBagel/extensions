# extensions
assorted moldy browser extensions I made from a long time ago

They probably work:tm: ? I don't use any of them anymore, but if they're useful to you, they are public.

### Edgelord (Chromium)
Dark mode for Google Classroom & Drive. Probably still works.

### LonCapaUI (Chromium)
Increased legibility and focus for LonCapa. Probably still works.

### Outlook Niceifier (Chakra Edge / Chromium (?))
Removes the ad sidebar & adds a background like the desktop Mail & Calendar app for Windows. Least likely to work today.
